# ft_printf - 42 Project

This project is all about re-creating the famous `printf` function from the C standard library. The goal is to understand variadic functions, formatting, and output handling by building a simplified but powerful version yourself.

This project helped me get better at:

- Working with variadic arguments (`va_list`)  
- Parsing and handling format specifiers  
- Managing output buffering and formatting  
- Writing modular and efficient C code  

---

## Features

- Supports standard format specifiers like `%c`, `%s`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, and `%p`  
- Properly outputs formatted strings to stdout  
- Adheres to the 42 coding style and norm
